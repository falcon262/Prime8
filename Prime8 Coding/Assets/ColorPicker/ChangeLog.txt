********************************************
****************** V 1.0.7 *****************
*************** Feb 27, 2021 ***************
********************************************

- Updated Options demo scene to include presets
- Updated DefaultColorPicker demo scene so that it demonstrates both V1 and V2, as well as how each one can be used.
- Fixed a bug when using the pipette/eyedropper in the editor. Seems like Unity also fixed the 'known issue' related to this :)

********************************************
****************** V 1.0.6 *****************
*************** Dec 01, 2020 ***************
********************************************

- Added: ColorSwatch and preset components. Accessible through menu-item 'UI/ColorPicker/Swatch'
- Added: DefaultColorPicker V2 demo prefab, this is a new prefab to make sure stuff doesn't break for existing users, the folowing things are different compared to V1:
			Added swatch and presets
			The icons for the colorbox now also have a selected state
			Has a ColorPickerWindow instead of a PopupWindow, which can be instantiated using PopupWindow.Open aswell, meaning you can access the actual ColorPicker through code more easilly
- Added: The GradientBoxSwitcher script now has a toggle for AlwaysShowHue, if toggled it will show the hue in the GradientBox even when the current saturation or value/light set in the slider overwrite the hue
- Updated: Readme now contains information about the new components

Note: When adding a swatch through menuitems, make sure to assign the 'Preset Prefab' before using

************** UPDATE WARNING **************

If you edited anything inside the demo folder, these things might break as I made changes here.
I tried to make sure it just keeps working, but I can't guarantee, so be sure to make a backup before updating!




********************************************
****************** V 1.0.5 *****************
*************** Nov 19, 2020 ***************
********************************************

- Added: TextMeshPro (TMP) versions for the Label, Input and Hexfield components

TMP is completely optional, the menuItems and components are only available when you include TextMeshPro using the packagemanager to your project.

In order to allow both a TMP version as well as a non-TMP version, I've placed my code in different assemblies.
- Which means that if you want to, you can even delete the 'ColorPicker/Scripts/builtinText' folder if you don't want to include the regular ui text in your project (Note that this will break the examples that use these components)
- Also slightly improves compile time when making changes to your own code as it no longer has to re-compile code in this package.

*************** Update notice **************
********************************************

This updates moves a lot of files to new locations within the 'Assets/ColorPicker/Scripts/' folder.
Unity's package update logic doesn't handle that very well. Therefore, when updating you should take the following steps
- if you for some reason created any custom script inside 'Assets/ColorPicker/Scripts/', make a backup of them
- Remove this folder and all its contents 'Assets/ColorPicker/Scripts/'
- import the new package
Done :)

If you've updated without reading this notice and got a lot of errors in the console as a result, you can follow the above steps to fix the problem aswell.




********************************************
****************** V 1.0.4 *****************
*************** Nov 16, 2020 ***************
********************************************

- Fixed: HexField did not allow you to enter the letters abcdef in lower case
- Added: Option to ignore channels in HexField, usefull for when you want to allow the user to copy/paste a hex containing an alpha but you want to ignore that alpha
- Other: Fixed broken url in readme, as well as some typos.




********************************************
****************** V 1.0.3 *****************
*************** Oct 15, 2020 ***************
********************************************

- Fixed: Updated code to no longer use methods marked as deprecated.
- Fixed: Input, Label, Slider and hexfield had a bug which caused the Type enum fields to be not working as intended
- Fixed: Due to a change in a recent version of Unity 2020, CanvasRenderer was not automatically added to all the GradientBackgrounds anymore, resulting in runtime exceptions
	existing ColorPickers that were updated to Unity 2020 didn't suffer from this problem as they already had a CanvasRenderer attached.
	ColorComponents created in recent versions of Unity2020 didn't work as intented and threw a lot of runtime errors, 

These fixed should not change or break any existing ColorPickers.
	If you are using Unity 2020 or later you should update to this new version as you can't create new ColorPickers otherwise.
	If you are using Unity 2019 LTS, I would advise to update to this new version as if makes editing existing ColorPickers work better.




********************************************
****************** V 1.0.2 *****************
*************** Nov 01, 2016 ***************
********************************************

The ColorSlider and GradientBox now respect the minimum/maximum value of the slider, min and max value should be normalized values (between 0 and 1).
-	ColorSlider and Gradientbox don't use the sliders normalized value anymore, instead they use their actual value.
-	Added error messages to ColorSlider and GradientBox inspectors for when the slider's min and max values are not set between 0 and 1.

************** UPDATE WARNING **************

When updating from a previous version, this change can (although unlikely) break your existing colorpicker sliders!

Slider2D's will have their min and max values reset with this update. But sinse they were ignored by the GradientBox anyway, this shouldn't cause any problems.
ColorSliders won't have their min and max values reset, you'll have to do this manually if you changed them!
For any normal ColorSlider the min value should be 0 and the max value should be 1.

If you have written your own code that expects the slider his value to be between a different range then 0 - 1 (0-255 for instance).
You'll need to update that piece of code when you update to this new version!
This only applies to the slider and slider2D values, not to the values you can get from the colorpicker itself!
